This code is the experimental code of paper "Unsupervised Dynamic Discrete Structure Learning:A Geometric Evolution Method"
Environment: Python=3.9, torch=1.12

learner.py use to train in manifold learning task.
RGC+Gemetric_Flow fold use for latent graph learning task, all the dataset used for latent graph learning task can be found in data/lantent_graph_learning/.

Whether in latent graph learning task or graph neural network task, you need to update the weight matrix using the model.py file.
