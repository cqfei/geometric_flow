This code is the experimental code of paper "Unsupervised Dynamic Discrete Structure Learning:A Geometric Evolution Method"

## Environment Setting: 
Python=3.9, torch=1.12

## Documentation Guide:
1. learner.py is used to train in manifold learning task.

2. RGC+Gemetric_Flow fold use for latent graph learning task, all the dataset used for latent graph learning task can be found in data/lantent_graph_learning/.

## Instuctionsï¼›
Whether in latent graph learning task or graph neural network task, you need to update the weight matrix using the model.py file.

You should prepare the dataset for graph neural network task by yourself.
