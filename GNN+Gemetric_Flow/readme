You should configure "choices" item in file './config.json'. Take the following configuration as example.

model_name means the training model, for example 0 represents GCN.
model_arg_debug means the order value of hyperparameter setting for hidden_dim, learning_rate, weight_decay, epochs. 
cross_num means the number of cross-validation times for different datasets.
ricci_flow means whether use gemetric flow, 0 mean True.
dataset_name means the training dataset.
device means GPU device.
add_edge_weight means whether use weight in training.
round means training round.
epoch_step means how many epochs the model is evaluated and how many epochs the best model is saved.

"choices": {
    "model_name": 0,
    "cross_num": 0,
    "model_arg_debug": 33,
    "ricci_flow": 0,
    "dataset_name": 0,
    "device": 4,
    "add_edge_weight": true,
    "round": 10,
    "epoch_step": 10
  },

A good suggestion is that you'd better update weight matrix first using "model.py" in root fold, before you use gemetric flow to update weight matrix during your training.
